# Bird Netting Maintenance & Care: Maximizing Lifespan and Effectiveness

Professional bird netting is a long-term investment designed to last 5-15 years or more with proper care. However, like any protective system, bird netting requires regular maintenance to ensure continued effectiveness, maximize lifespan, and protect your investment. Neglected netting can deteriorate prematurely, develop gaps, or lose effectiveness, undermining the benefits you've invested in.

This comprehensive guide covers everything you need to know about bird netting maintenance, from inspection schedules and cleaning procedures to repair techniques and professional service options.

## Why Bird Netting Maintenance Matters
