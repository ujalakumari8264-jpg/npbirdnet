        content:
          'Bird net installation involves strategically placing durable netting materials across vulnerable areas of your property to create a physical barrier that prevents birds from accessing specific zones. Unlike harmful methods, bird netting is a humane solution that simply denies birds access without causing them injury. The netting is typically made from high-density polyethylene (HDPE) or nylon materials that are UV-stabilized, weather-resistant, and designed to last for years.',

          'Birds, particularly pigeons, carry over 60 diseases that can be transmitted to humans through their droppings, feathers, and nesting materials. These include Histoplasmosis, Cryptococcosis, Psittacosis, Salmonella, and E. coli. Bird droppings are also highly acidic and can corrode building materials, damage paint, and create slippery surfaces that pose slip-and-fall hazards. Professional bird net installation prevents these issues before they escalate into expensive repairs.',
